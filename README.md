### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an 18 y/o college student.

I create stuff with clean and maintainable code, a good looking UI with decent UX (aesthetics are very important imo) and a short but unique and powerful list of features.

### Some info
- Pronouns: **He/Him**
- Preferred language to communicate: **English**
- Languages known: **Kotlin, Python, Java, Typescript/JS, Perl (Perl 5), C**

  Sorted in descending order of knowledge in each. (from most knowledgable in to
  moderately knowledgable).

  Know basics of **C++** (really mean it when I say "basics" here), **C#**
  (The Microsoft Java lol) and **Rust** but nowhere close to using it to create
  something other than simple terminal programs like a primitive calculator.

  Kind of decent in using bash/zsh and powershell (_and cmd_)

  _Also, I know HTML and CSS other than these but who cares?_

- How to reach: Either by [mail](mailto:supershadoe@proton.me), by matrix (@supershadoe:matrix.org) or by discord (supershadoe#5495)

  First 2 are preferred though except for queries related to the discord bot.

Check [this list](https://github.com/stars/supershadoe/lists/contrib) for stuff
I have made a contribution in the past and pinned repos (or the "self-star"
list on my star lists) on my profile for stuff I have worked.

_Also, the apps in the "contrib" list are good so maybe try using them once._
