### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an 18 y/o student.
- Pronouns: **He/Him**
- Preferred language to communicate: **English**
- Languages known: **Kotlin, Python, Perl 5**

  Some basic knowledge of Java (as I learnt it a bit before learning Kotlin) and C (basic stuff).

  A lot of other languages like C#, HTML, CSS, JS, PowerShell, bash/zsh but the "Programming languages" I know are the ones mentioned above.
- How to reach: Either by [mail](mailto:supershadoe@proton.me), by matrix (@supershadoe:matrix.org) or by discord (supershadoe#5495)

  First 2 are preferred though except for queries related to the discord bot.

Check [pinned repos](https://github.com/supershadoe) for stuff I have worked on.
