### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an 18 y/o high school student.

I try to make unique stuff or stuff which I need which can make the lives of me and the ones using it easier/better. Or something that I really despise the UI of (which still comes under my goal of making lives easier/better).

> Some rant: In my opinion, when people say "first impressions are the best impressions", it also applies to software. An app which has all features with bad UI is as good as three other apps with good UI but each having one feature each; Makes UX worse while making the effort needed to perform a job more.

### Some info
- Pronouns: **He/Him**
- Preferred language to communicate: **English**
- Languages known: **Kotlin, Python, Perl 5**

  Some basic knowledge of Java (as I learnt it a bit before learning Kotlin) and C (basic stuff).

  A lot of other languages like C#, HTML, CSS, JS, PowerShell, bash/zsh but the "Programming languages" I know are the ones mentioned above.
- How to reach: Either by [mail](mailto:supershadoe@proton.me), by matrix (@supershadoe:matrix.org) or by discord (supershadoe#5495)

  First 2 are preferred though except for queries related to the discord bot.

Check [pinned repos](https://github.com/supershadoe) for stuff I have worked on.
